File System Simulation

This is a basic file system simulator built in Java. It lets you create folders and files, navigate between directories, list contents, and print the full structure — all in memory through a custom command-line interface.

Supported commands:
- mkdir [folder]  → Create a folder
- touch [file]    → Create a file
- ls              → List current directory contents
- cd [folder]     → Move into a folder
- cd ..           → Move up to the parent folder
- pwd             → Show current path
- tree            → Show the full folder/file structure
- exit            → Quit the program
